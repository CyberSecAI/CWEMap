      "**Description:** An issue was discovered in **linqi** before **1.4.0.1** on **Windows**. There is **LDAP injection**. NVD REFERENCE LINK INFO: The attacker can use wildcards to query LDAP entries. The user must have an authorized user.\n",

      "### Errors and Corrections:\n",
      "1. **CVE ID Validation:**\n",
      "   - The CVE ID \"CVE-2024-33868\" was not found in the CSV searches, which raises questions about its validity. Consider verifying this CVE ID from an authoritative source.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Description:**\n",
      "   - \"The user must have an authorized user\" should be corrected to \"The attacker must be an authorized user.\"\n",
      "   - \"NVD REFERENCE LINK INFO\" is vague. It should either be removed or replaced with an actual reference link.\n",
