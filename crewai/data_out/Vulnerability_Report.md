# Vulnerability Report

## Original Vulnerability Description
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Web Manager SslGenerateCSR functionality of Lantronix PremierWave 2050 8.9.0.0R4 (in QEMU). A specially crafted HTTP request can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.
