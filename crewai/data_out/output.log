[CVE ID] CVE-2023-25187
[CWE ID] CWE-798
[DESCRIPTION] An issue was discovered on NOKIA Airscale ASIKA Single RAN devices before 21B. Nokia Single RAN commissioning procedures do not change (factory-time installed) default SSH public/private key values that are specific to a network operator. As a result, the CSP internal BTS network SSH server (disabled by default) continues to apply the default SSH public/private key values. These keys don't give access to BTS, because service user authentication is username/password-based on top of SSH. Nokia factory installed default SSH keys are meant to be changed from operator-specific values during the BTS deployment commissioning phase. However, before the 21B release, BTS commissioning manuals did not provide instructions to change default SSH keys (to BTS operator-specific values). This leads to a possibility for malicious operations staff (inside a CSP network) to attempt MITM exploitation of BTS service user access, during the moments that SSH is enabled for Nokia service personnel to perform troubleshooting activities.

[CVE ID] CVE-2021-29486
[CWE ID] CWE-20, CWE-835
[DESCRIPTION] cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in2024-09-08 22:35:24: status=completed

2. Some mentions of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and arbitrary code execution in other network-related software, but not specifically for Cisco Discovery Protocol or Cisco IOS XR.

It's important to note that the absence of a direct match in the CSV doesn't mean that the vulnerability described doesn't exist or isn't significant. It may be that this specific vulnerability is not included in the Top 25 CWE Mappings dataset we searched, or it might be a more recent discovery not yet added to the database.

The original context describes a vulnerability with the following characteristics:
- Affects Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation in Cisco IOS XR Software
- Involves improper validation of string input from certain fields in Cisco Discovery Protocol messages
- Can be exploited by an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
- Impact includes the ability to execute arbitrary code or cause a reload on an affected device
- The attack vector involves sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device

While we couldn't find an exact match, this vulnerability appears to be a serious security issue that could potentially be classified under categories like CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) or CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), depending on the exact nature of the improper validation.2024-09-10 10:29:47: status=completed

[DESCRIPTION] cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when2024-09-10 21:41:30: status=completed

[DESCRIPTION] cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric data [1,22024-09-10 21:53:59: status=completed

[CVE ID] CVE-2023-25194
[CWE ID] CWE-502
[DESCRIPTION] A possible security vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka Connect API.
This requires access to a Kafka Connect worker, and the ability to create/modify connectors on it with an arbitrary Kafka client SASL JAAS config
and a SASL-based security protocol, which has been possible on Kafka Connect clusters since Apache Kafka Connect 2.3.0.
When configuring the connector via the Kafka Connect REST API, an authenticated operator can set the `sasl.jaas.config`
property for any of the connector's Kafka clients to "com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule", which can be done via the
`producer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, `consumer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, or `admin.override.sasl.jaas.config` properties.
This will allow the server to connect to the attacker's LDAP server
and deserialize the LDAP response, which the attacker can use to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server.
Attacker can cause unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data (or) RCE vulnerability when there are gadgets in the classpath.

Since Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users are allowed to specify these properties in connector configurations for Kafka Connect clusters running with out-of-the-box
configurations. Before Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users may not specify these properties unless the Kafka Connect cluster has been reconfigured with a connector
client override policy that permits them.

Since Apache Kafka 3.4.0, we have added a system property ("-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules") to disable the problematic login modules usage
in SASL JAAS configuration. Also by default "com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule" is disabled in Apache Kafka Connect 3.4.0. 

We advise the Kafka Connect users to validate connector configurations and only allow trusted JNDI configurations. Also examine connector dependencies for 
vulnerable versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that specific dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation. Finally,
in addition to leveraging the "org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules" system property, Kafka Connect users can also implement their own connector
client config override policy, which can be used to control which Kafka client properties can be overridden directly in a connector config and which cannot.2024-09-12 10:32:36: status=completed

1. CVE-2019-3568: A buffer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp VOIP stack allowed remote code execution via specially crafted series of SRTCP packets sent to a target phone number.

Description: This vulnerability is similar to the FortiOS and FortiProxy SSL-VPN case as it involves a remote, unauthenticated attacker exploiting a heap-based buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code.

2. CVE-2018-4121: A heap buffer overflow in WebKit allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Apple devices.

Description: This vulnerability shares similarities with the FortiOS/FortiProxy case, as it involves a remote attacker exploiting a heap-based buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code.

3. CVE-2017-0144: The SMBv1 server in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2 through Windows 10, and Windows Server 2008 SP2 through Windows Server 2016, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted packets (aka "Windows SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerability").

Description: While not specifically labeled as a heap-based buffer overflow, this vulnerability involves remote code execution through crafted requests, similar to the FortiOS/FortiProxy case.

4. CVE-2016-5195 (Dirty COW): A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings.

Description: Although this is a different type of vulnerability, it demonstrates how memory corruption issues can lead to privilege escalation and arbitrary code execution, which are potential impacts of heap-based buffer overflows.

5. CVE-2014-1776: A use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 11 allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted website.

Description: While this is a use-after-free vulnerability rather than a heap-based buffer overflow, it demonstrates how memory corruption vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, similar to the FortiOS/FortiProxy case.

These examples, while not directly from the CWE Observed Examples database, illustrate common patterns in heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities and similar memory corruption issues:

1. Remote exploitation: Many of these vulnerabilities can be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers.
2. Arbitrary code execution: The impact often includes the ability to execute arbitrary code or commands.
3. Crafted input: Attackers typically use specially crafted requests or input to trigger the vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Description

A vulnerability has been identified in cpCommerce versions 1.2.x, possibly including 1.2.9. The issue is located in the **_functions.php** file, which sends a redirect but **does not exit when it is called directly** [CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value]. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass a protection mechanism and conduct various attacks, including:

1. Remote file inclusion [CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program]
2. Directory traversal [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')]
3. Arbitrary PHP code execution [CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')]
4. Arbitrary file read

The attack vector involves manipulating the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter, which is a different vector than the one used in CVE-2003-1500.

### Root Cause and Weakness Chain

1. **Root Cause [CWE-252]**: The _functions.php file sends a redirect but does not exit when called directly. This is an instance of an unchecked return value, where the script continues execution after sending a redirect header.

2. **Weakness Chain**:
   a. **[CWE-98]**: The lack of proper exit after redirect allows attackers to exploit PHP's include/require statements, potentially leading to remote file inclusion.
   b. **[CWE-22]**: The vulnerability enables directory traversal attacks, allowing attackers to access files and directories that should be restricted.
   c. **[CWE-94]**: As a result of the previous weaknesses, attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
   d. The combination of these weaknesses also allows for arbitrary file read, further compromising the system's security.

### Impact

The vulnerability allows remote attackers to:
1. Bypass protection mechanisms intended to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and functionality.
2. Include and execute arbitrary PHP files from remote locations.
3. Navigate outside of the intended directory structure, potentially accessing sensitive system files.
4. Execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, which could lead to complete system compromise.
5. Read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.

### Recommendations

1. Implement proper exit functionality after sending redirect headers in _functions.php.
2. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter and any other user-controllable inputs.
3. Use PHP's built-in functions like `basename()` and `realpath()` to ensure that included files are within the intended directory.
4. Implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.
5. Consider upgrading to the latest version of cpCommerce if a patched version is available.
6. Regularly audit and update the codebase to address potential security vulnerabilities.

By addressing these issues, the overall security posture of the cpCommerce application will be significantly improved, mitigating the risk of exploitation through this vulnerability.2024-09-12 22:58:06: status=completed

[PRODUCT]: cpCommerce

[VERSION]: 1.2.x, possibly including 1.2.9

[ATTACKER]: Remote attackers

[IMPACT]: Bypass protection mechanism, conduct remote file inclusion and directory traversal attacks, execute arbitrary PHP code, read arbitrary files

[VECTOR]: GLOBALS[prefix] parameter

[ROOTCAUSE]: _functions.php sends a redirect but does not exit when it is called directly

This vulnerability description highlights a security flaw in the cpCommerce e-commerce platform, specifically in versions 1.2.x (potentially including version 1.2.9). The issue stems from improper handling of redirects in the _functions.php file. When this file is called directly, it sends a redirect but fails to terminate execution, creating a security loophole.

Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter. This allows them to bypass existing protection mechanisms and carry out various malicious actions, including:

1. Remote file inclusion
2. Directory traversal attacks
3. Execution of arbitrary PHP code
4. Reading of arbitrary files

It's important to note that this vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2003-1500, which likely addressed a similar but separate issue in the same software.

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the incomplete implementation of the redirect mechanism in _functions.php. By not terminating execution after sending the redirect, the script leaves an opening for attackers to manipulate the application's behavior and gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data.2024-09-13 10:37:19: status=completed

agent=Report Reviewer2024-09-13 10:38:53: task=## Revised Vulnerability Report

**Vulnerability Description:**
The _functions.php file in cpCommerce 1.2.x, possibly including version 1.2.9, contains a critical vulnerability that allows remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms and conduct various malicious activities. The root cause of this vulnerability is that [ROOTCAUSE: CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value] the _functions.php file sends a redirect but does not exit when it is called directly. This oversight enables attackers to exploit the following weaknesses:

1. [WEAKNESS: CWE-98: Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement in PHP Program ('PHP Remote File Inclusion')] Remote file inclusion
2. [WEAKNESS: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')] Directory traversal
3. [WEAKNESS: CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')] Arbitrary PHP code execution
4. [WEAKNESS: CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor] Arbitrary file reading

The attack vector for these vulnerabilities is the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter, which can be manipulated by remote attackers to bypass existing protection mechanisms.

**Chain of Root Cause and Weaknesses:**
1. [ROOTCAUSE: CWE-252] The _functions.php file fails to properly terminate execution after sending a redirect.
2. This allows attackers to continue execution and access sensitive parts of the application.
3. [WEAKNESS: CWE-98] Attackers can exploit this to include remote files, potentially executing malicious code.
4. [WEAKNESS: CWE-22] The vulnerability also enables directory traversal attacks, allowing access to files outside the intended directory structure.
5. [WEAKNESS: CWE-94] As a result of the previous weaknesses, attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
6. [WEAKNESS: CWE-200] The combination of these vulnerabilities also allows attackers to read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Impact:**
The impact of this vulnerability is severe, as it allows remote attackers to:
- Bypass existing protection mechanisms
- Execute arbitrary PHP code on the server
- Access and read sensitive files
- Potentially take control of the affected system

**Affected Versions:**
cpCommerce 1.2.x, possibly including version 1.2.9

**Recommendation:**
It is strongly recommended that users of cpCommerce 1.2.x, especially those using version 1.2.9 or earlier, update to the latest patched version immediately. If an update is not possible, the following mitigations should be implemented:

1. Ensure that the _functions.php file properly terminates execution after sending redirects.
2. Implement strong input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, especially the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter.
3. Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out potentially malicious requests.
4. Apply the principle of least privilege to limit the potential impact of successful exploits.
5. Regularly audit and update all dependencies and components of the cpCommerce application.

[CWE ID] CWE-798
[DESCRIPTION] An issue was discovered on NOKIA Airscale ASIKA Single RAN devices before 21B. Nokia Single RAN commissioning procedures do not change (factory-time installed) default SSH public/private key values that are specific to a network operator. As a result, the CSP internal BTS network SSH server (disabled by default) continues to apply the default SSH public/private key values. These keys don't give access to BTS, because service user authentication is username/password-based on top of SSH. Nokia factory installed default SSH keys are meant to be changed from operator-specific values during the BTS deployment commissioning phase. However, before the 21B release, BTS commissioning manuals did not provide instructions to change default SSH keys (to BTS operator-specific values). This leads to a possibility for malicious operations staff (inside a CSP network) to attempt MITM exploitation of BTS service user access, during the moments that SSH is enabled for Nokia service personnel to perform troubleshooting activities.

[CVE ID] CVE-2023-25187
[CWE ID] CWE-798
[DESCRIPTION] An issue was discovered on NOKIA Airscale ASIKA Single RAN devices before 21B. Nokia Single RAN commissioning procedures do not change (factory-time installed) default SSH public/private key values that are specific to a network operator. As a result, the CSP internal BTS network SSH server (disabled by default) continues to apply the default SSH public/private key values. These keys don't give access to BTS, because service user authentication is username/password-based on top of SSH. Nokia factory installed default SSH keys are meant to be changed from operator-specific values during the BTS deployment commissioning phase. However, before the 21B release, BTS commissioning manuals did not provide instructions to change default SSH keys (to BTS operator-specific values). This leads to a possibility for malicious operations staff (inside a CSP network) to attempt MITM exploitation of BTS service user access, during the moments that SSH is enabled for Nokia service personnel to perform troubleshooting activities.

This level of detail is good, but we couldn't find corroborating information in our database. Recommendation: Provide additional context or references to support this specific attack vector.

5. Impact: The report correctly states that the vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code, which is consistent with typical SQL Injection impacts.

6. Root Cause: The identified root cause, "Lack of proper input validation or sanitization," is accurate and consistent with typical SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

7. CWE Assignment: The assignment of CWE-89 (SQL Injection) is correct and appropriate for the described vulnerability.

8. Similar CVEs: The report provides relevant examples of similar SQL Injection vulnerabilities, which helps to contextualize the issue.

9. Chain of Root Cause and Weaknesses: The provided chain is logical and accurately represents the progression from root cause to impact.

Overall, the report appears to be well-structured and contains the essential elements of a vulnerability report. However, due to the lack of corroborating information in our database for the specific CVE and product, we cannot fully verify all details. The report passes most checks for accuracy and completeness, but with the caveat that some details require further verification.
