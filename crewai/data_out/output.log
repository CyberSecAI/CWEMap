[CVE ID] CVE-2023-25187
[CWE ID] CWE-798
[DESCRIPTION] An issue was discovered on NOKIA Airscale ASIKA Single RAN devices before 21B. Nokia Single RAN commissioning procedures do not change (factory-time installed) default SSH public/private key values that are specific to a network operator. As a result, the CSP internal BTS network SSH server (disabled by default) continues to apply the default SSH public/private key values. These keys don't give access to BTS, because service user authentication is username/password-based on top of SSH. Nokia factory installed default SSH keys are meant to be changed from operator-specific values during the BTS deployment commissioning phase. However, before the 21B release, BTS commissioning manuals did not provide instructions to change default SSH keys (to BTS operator-specific values). This leads to a possibility for malicious operations staff (inside a CSP network) to attempt MITM exploitation of BTS service user access, during the moments that SSH is enabled for Nokia service personnel to perform troubleshooting activities.

[CVE ID] CVE-2021-29486
[CWE ID] CWE-20, CWE-835
[DESCRIPTION] cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in2024-09-08 22:35:24: status=completed

2. Some mentions of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and arbitrary code execution in other network-related software, but not specifically for Cisco Discovery Protocol or Cisco IOS XR.

It's important to note that the absence of a direct match in the CSV doesn't mean that the vulnerability described doesn't exist or isn't significant. It may be that this specific vulnerability is not included in the Top 25 CWE Mappings dataset we searched, or it might be a more recent discovery not yet added to the database.

The original context describes a vulnerability with the following characteristics:
- Affects Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation in Cisco IOS XR Software
- Involves improper validation of string input from certain fields in Cisco Discovery Protocol messages
- Can be exploited by an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
- Impact includes the ability to execute arbitrary code or cause a reload on an affected device
- The attack vector involves sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device

While we couldn't find an exact match, this vulnerability appears to be a serious security issue that could potentially be classified under categories like CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) or CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow), depending on the exact nature of the improper validation.2024-09-10 10:29:47: status=completed

[DESCRIPTION] cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric data [1,2,3,4,5] when2024-09-10 21:41:30: status=completed

[DESCRIPTION] cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may confuse an array of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric data [1,22024-09-10 21:53:59: status=completed
