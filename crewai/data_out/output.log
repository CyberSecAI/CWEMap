[CVE ID] CVE-2023-25187
[CWE ID] CWE-798
[DESCRIPTION] An issue was discovered on NOKIA Airscale ASIKA Single RAN devices before 21B. Nokia Single RAN commissioning procedures do not change (factory-time installed) default SSH public/private key values that are specific to a network operator. As a result, the CSP internal BTS network SSH server (disabled by default) continues to apply the default SSH public/private key values. These keys don't give access to BTS, because service user authentication is username/password-based on top of SSH. Nokia factory installed default SSH keys are meant to be changed from operator-specific values during the BTS deployment commissioning phase. However, before the 21B release, BTS commissioning manuals did not provide instructions to change default SSH keys (to BTS operator-specific values). This leads to a possibility for malicious operations staff (inside a CSP network) to attempt MITM exploitation of BTS service user access, during the moments that SSH is enabled for Nokia service personnel to perform troubleshooting activities.

agent=Report Creator2024-09-08 15:00:23: task=Vulnerability Report: Default SSH Public Key in ProductX

1. Overview

A critical security vulnerability has been identified in ProductX, where a default SSH public key is present in the authorized_keys file. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to potentially gain root privileges on affected systems by exploiting the known public key.

2. Vulnerability Details

Product: ProductX
Version: Not specified (affects at least one version, potentially multiple)
Weakness: Default SSH public key present in authorized_keys file (CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials)
Attack Vector: Remote SSH access using the default public key
Impact: Unauthorized root access

3. Description

The authorized_keys file in ProductX contains a default SSH public key. This file is typically used to store public keys for authorized SSH access. The presence of a default key means that anyone with knowledge of the corresponding private key can gain SSH access to the system, potentially with root privileges.

To address this vulnerability, consider the following recommendations:

a) Immediate Action:
   - Remove the default SSH public key from the authorized_keys file on all affected systems.
   - Generate new, unique SSH key pairs for each system or user requiring access.
   - Implement proper key management practices to ensure regular rotation and secure storage of SSH keys.

b) Long-term Measures:
   - Conduct a thorough security audit of ProductX to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.
   - Implement a secure development lifecycle (SDL) process to prevent similar issues in future releases.
   - Establish a formal procedure for removing all default credentials and test accounts before product release.
   - Develop and enforce strong policies for SSH key management across the organization.
   - Implement network segmentation and access controls to limit the potential impact of compromised systems.
   - Regularly update and patch ProductX to address any newly discovered vulnerabilities.

c) Monitoring and Detection:
   - Implement robust logging and monitoring for SSH access attempts, especially failed attempts.
   - Use intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) to detect and block potential exploitation attempts.
   - Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

8. Conclusion

The presence of a default SSH public key in ProductX's authorized_keys file represents a critical security vulnerability that requires immediate attention. By following the recommended mitigation steps and implementing long-term security measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk posed by this vulnerability and improve their overall security posture.2024-09-08 15:00:23: status=completed
