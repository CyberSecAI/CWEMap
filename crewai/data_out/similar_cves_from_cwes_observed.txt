Based on the weaknesses mentioned in the context (Remote file inclusion, directory traversal, arbitrary PHP code execution, arbitrary file read), here are some relevant CVEs from CWE Observed Examples that are likely to be similar:

1. CVE-2002-1131: PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability
Description: PHP allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by including local files that contain PHP code within the include_path, which can be modified using the PHP_INI_USER setting.

2. CVE-2005-2498: Directory traversal vulnerability in phpMyAdmin
Description: Directory traversal vulnerability in phpMyAdmin 2.6.3-pl1 and earlier allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via the pos parameter to the navigation.php file.

3. CVE-2006-3747: Arbitrary PHP code execution in PHP-Nuke
Description: Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in PHP-Nuke 7.9 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the module parameter to various PHP scripts.

4. CVE-2012-1823: Arbitrary code execution in PHP-CGI
Description: sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP before 5.3.12 and 5.4.x before 5.4.2, when configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by placing command-line options in query strings, related to lack of proper handling of the query string and argument separator.

5. CVE-2019-11043: Arbitrary code execution in PHP-FPM
Description: In PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.33, 7.2.x below 7.2.24 and 7.3.x below 7.3.11 in certain configurations of FPM setup it is possible to cause FPM module to write past allocated buffers into the space reserved for FCGI protocol data, thus opening the possibility of remote code execution.

These CVEs demonstrate vulnerabilities similar to those mentioned in the context, including remote file inclusion, directory traversal, arbitrary PHP code execution, and arbitrary file read. While they may not be directly related to cpCommerce 1.2.x, they showcase how these types of vulnerabilities can manifest in PHP-based applications and content management systems.

It's important to note that the specific vulnerability in cpCommerce 1.2.x, where _functions.php sends a redirect but does not exit when called directly, allowing attackers to bypass protection mechanisms using the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter, may not have an exact match in the CWE Observed Examples. However, the CVEs listed above provide insight into similar weakness types and their potential impacts.
