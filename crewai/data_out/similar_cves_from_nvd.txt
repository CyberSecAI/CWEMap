Based on the searches conducted in the National Vulnerability Database, here are the most relevant CVEs related to SSH vulnerabilities and root access, which share some similarities with the given context:

1. CVE-2023-26315
   Weakness Enumeration: Not specified in the search results
   Description: The Xiaomi router AX9000 has a post-authentication command injection vulnerability. This vulnerability is caused by the lack of input filtering, allowing an attacker to exploit it to obtain root access to the device.
   CVSS v3.1: 8.8 HIGH

While this CVE doesn't specifically mention SSH or authorized_keys, it involves obtaining root access on a network device, which is similar to the impact described in the given context.

It's important to note that the specific vulnerability described in the context (default SSH public key present in authorized_keys file) is not directly represented by any CVEs found in the current search results. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The vulnerability might be too recent and not yet included in the NVD database.
2. The vulnerability might be specific to ProductX and not publicly disclosed.
3. The vulnerability might be considered a misonfiguration rather than a software flaw, and thus not assigned a CVE.

In general, the presence of a default SSH public key in the authorized_keys file is a serious security issue that can be classified under the following CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) categories:

- CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
- CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions

While not exactly matching the given context, the CVE-2023-26315 demonstrates that vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized root access are considered high-severity issues.

For the specific issue described (default SSH public key in authorized_keys), the following security best practices should be followed:

1. Remove any default or unnecessary SSH keys from the authorized_keys file.
2. Implement strong key management practices, including regular key rotation.
3. Audit SSH configurations and access regularly.
4. Use principle of least privilege when granting SSH access.

It's recommended to consult with the vendor of ProductX for any known vulnerabilities or security advisories related to this specific issue.
