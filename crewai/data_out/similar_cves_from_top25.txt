Based on the searches conducted, here are the most relevant CVEs with similar weakness keyphrases to the Cisco IOS XR vulnerability involving improper validation of string input in the Cisco Discovery Protocol:

CVE: CVE-2021-21961
CWE: CWE-121
Description: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the NBNS functionality of Sealevel Systems, Inc. SeaConnect 370W v1.3.34. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.
Chains: CWE-20->CWE-121
Weakness_Description: stack-based buffer overflow

CVE: CVE-2021-21960
CWE: CWE-1284
Description: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in both the LLMNR functionality of Sealevel Systems, Inc. SeaConnect 370W v1.3.34. A specially-crafted network packet can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.
Chains: 
Weakness_Description: stack-based buffer overflow

These CVEs share similarities with the Cisco IOS XR vulnerability in that they involve:
1. Improper validation of input in network protocols
2. Potential for remote code execution
3. Exploitation through specially crafted network packets
4. Vulnerabilities in network-related functionalities

While these are not exact matches for the Cisco Discovery Protocol vulnerability, they represent similar weaknesses in handling network protocol messages, which can lead to code execution by unauthenticated attackers.
