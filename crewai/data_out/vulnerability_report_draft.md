## Original Vulnerability Description

**_functions.php** in cpCommerce 1.2.x, possibly including 1.2.9, sends a redirect but **does not exit when it is called directly**, which allows remote attackers to bypass a protection mechanism to conduct **remote file inclusion and directory traversal attacks**, execute arbitrary PHP code, or read arbitrary files via the GLOBALS[prefix] parameter, a different vector than CVE-2003-1500.
