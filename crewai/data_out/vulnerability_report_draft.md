# Vulnerability Report

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Original vulnerability description | The Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation in Cisco IOS XR Software does not do improper validation of string input from certain fields which could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a reload on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of string input from certain fields in Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. |

| CWE-787, CWE-134 | Out-of-bounds Write, Use of Externally-Controlled Format String | CVE-2020-3118 | A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a reload on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of string input from certain fields in Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges on an affected device. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). |
| CWE-78 | Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') | CVE-2017-12243 | A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Manager, Cisco Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW), and Cisco Firepower 9300 Security Appliance could allow an authenticated, local attacker to obtain root shell privileges on the device, aka Command Injection. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of string input in the shell application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through the use of malicious commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain root shell privileges on the device. |
| CWE-20 | Improper Input Validation | CVE-2019-1831 | A vulnerability in the email message scanning of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured content filters on the device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the email body. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting specific character strings in the message. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured content filters that would normally drop the email. |
