WordPress plugin through 1.0 is lacking any CSRF check when saving its settings and verses, and do not sanitize or escape them when outputting them back in the page. This could allow attackers to make a logged-in admin change the settings, as well as add malicious verses containing JavaScript code in them, leading to Stored XSS issues. |

Since an HTML payload isn't properly escaped, it may be interpreted by a web browser led to this endpoint. JavaScript code may be executed on a victim's browser. Due to v1.9.26 adding a CSRF check, the XSS is only exploitable against unauthenticated users (as they all share the same nonce). |
