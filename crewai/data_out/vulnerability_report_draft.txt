Vulnerability Report: Default SSH Keys in Authorized_keys Files

1. Overview

This report addresses a critical security vulnerability affecting multiple devices and systems across various vendors. The core issue involves the presence of default SSH public keys in authorized_keys files, which can allow unauthorized remote access if an attacker has knowledge of the corresponding private key.

2. Affected Systems

The following systems have been identified as vulnerable:

- VMware Photos OS OVA 1.0 (before 2016-08-14)
- ExaGrid appliances (firmware before 4.8 P26)
- Ceragon FibeAir IP-10
- NOKIA Airscale ASIKA Single RAN devices (before 21B)
- Precor touchscreen consoles (P62, P80, and P82)

- CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
- CWE-320: Key Management Errors
- CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

3.3 Vulnerability Description:

The primary vulnerability stems from the presence of default SSH public keys in authorized_keys files on affected systems. This security flaw allows remote attackers to gain unauthorized SSH access by exploiting knowledge of the corresponding private key. In some cases, this can lead to root privileges on the compromised systems.

4. Potential Impact

The presence of default SSH keys poses severe security risks, including:

- Unauthorized remote access to affected systems
- Potential privilege escalation to root access
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks
- Compromise of sensitive information
- Potential for lateral movement within networks
- Disruption of services or system integrity
