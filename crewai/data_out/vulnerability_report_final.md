## Original Vulnerability Description
**Type Confusion** in V8 in Google Chrome prior to 125.0.6422.76 allowed a remote attacker to potentially perform arbitrary read/write via a crafted HTML page. (Chromium security severity: High)

## Extracted Key Phrases
| Category | Value |
|----------|-------|
| [WEAKNESS] | **Type Confusion** |
| [PRODUCT] | V8 in Google Chrome |
| [COMPONENT] | V8 |
| [VERSION] | Prior to 125.0.6422.76 |
| [ATTACKER] | Remote attacker |
| [IMPACT] | Potential arbitrary read/write |
| [VECTOR] | Crafted HTML page |
| [ROOTCAUSE] | **Type confusion vulnerability in the V8 JavaScript engine** |

## Chain
The vulnerability chain starts with a **type confusion** weakness (CWE-843) in the V8 JavaScript engine of Google Chrome. This **root cause** allows a remote attacker to potentially perform arbitrary read/write operations, which could lead to further exploitation such as heap corruption or arbitrary code execution. The type confusion can potentially lead to a heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122), as seen in similar vulnerabilities.

## Assigned CWEs
| CWE-ID | CWE-Name | CWE-Description | CWE-Abstraction Level | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Label | CWE-Vulnerability Mapping Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| CWE-843 | Type Confusion | The program allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type. | Base | **Type Confusion** | This CWE directly relates to the **type confusion** vulnerability described in the original description. |
| CWE-122 | Heap-based Buffer Overflow | A heap overflow condition is a buffer overflow, where the buffer that can be overwritten is allocated in the heap portion of memory, generally meaning that the buffer was allocated using a routine such as malloc(). | Base | Potential Heap Corruption | While not explicitly mentioned in the original description, this CWE is often chained with CWE-843 in similar vulnerabilities and could be a potential consequence of the type confusion. |
