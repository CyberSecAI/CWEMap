USERGS_SYSRET64 is used to return from a syscall via SYSRET, but a Xen PV guest will nevertheless use the IRET hypercall, as there is no sysret PV hypercall defined.  So instead of testing all the prerequisites for doing a sysret and then mangling the stack for Xen PV again for doing an iret just use the iret exit from the beginning.  This can easily be done via an ALTERNATIVE like it is done for the sysenter compat case already.  It should be noted that this drops the optimization in Xen for not restoring a few registers when returning to user mode, but it seems as if the saved instructions in the kernel more than compensate for this drop (a kernel build in a Xen PV guest was slightly faster with this patch applied).  While at it remove the stale sysret32 remnants.

The problem was in wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().  Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case of any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well, when there is some kind of indicator, which can tell which parts of batadv are initialized; but there isn't any.  All written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide ODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work, syzbot was able to hit GPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]  To fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one. It is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling path 2) It improves the performance, since we won't call unneeded batadv_*_free() functions.  So, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory before returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free() and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching uninitialized fields.","","","","CWE-544","CWE-544 Missing Standardized Error Handling Mechanism"

Before unregistering from the notification chain, mlxsw will receive delete notifications for nexthop objects using netdevs registered by mlxsw or their uppers. mlxsw will not receive notifications for nexthops using netdevs that are not dismantled as part of the reload flow. For example, the blackhole nexthop above that internally uses the loopback netdev as its nexthop device.  One way to fix this problem is to have listeners flush their nexthop tables after unregistering from the notification chain. This is error-prone as evident by this patch and also not symmetric with the registration path where a listener receives a dump of all the existing nexthops.  Therefore, fix this problem by replaying delete notifications for the listener being unregistered. This is symmetric to the registration path and also consistent with the netdev notification chain.  The above means that unregister_nexthop_notifier(), like register_nexthop_notifier(), will have to take RTNL in order to iterate over the existing nexthops and that any callers of the function cannot hold RTNL. This is true for mlxsw and netdevsim, but not for the VXLAN driver. To avoid a deadlock, change the latter to unregister its nexthop listener without holding RTNL, making it symmetric to the registration path.

The bad MMU role can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when grabbing a shadow page's rmap for a page fault as the initial lookups for the gfn will happen with the vCPU's SMM flag (=0), whereas the rmap lookup will use the shadow page's SMM flag, which comes from the MMU (=1).

Resulting in a crash when those lowcore areas are used next (eg. on the next machine-check interrupt).  Such a scenario would typically happen when the device is first set online and its queues aren't allocated yet. An early IO error or certain misconfigs (eg. mismatched transport mode, bad portno) then cause us to error out from qeth_hardsetup_card() with card->qdio.in_q still being NULL.

This attack requires a user to use a terminal application that supports the translation of ANSI escape codes to read the malicious log file locally in the vulnerable terminal, and to perform additional user interaction to exploit. Universal Forwarder versions 9.1.0.1, 9.0.5, 8.2.11, and lower can be vulnerable in situations where they have management services active and accessible over the network. Universal Forwarder versions 9.0.x and 9.1.x bind management services to the local machine and are not vulnerable in this specific configuration. See SVD-2022-0605 for more information. Universal Forwarder versions 9.1 use Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for communication, which further reduces the potential attack surface. The vulnerability does not directly affect Splunk Enterprise or Universal Forwarder. The indirect impact on Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder can vary significantly depending on the permissions in the vulnerable terminal application and where and how the user reads the malicious log file.

First, it assumes that just because the sibling base device has been registered that means that it is also bound to a driver, which may not be the case (e.g. due to probe deferral or asynchronous probe). This could trigger a NULL-pointer dereference when attempting to access the driver data of the unbound device.  Second, it accesses driver data of a sibling device directly and without any locking, which means that the driver data may be freed while it is being accessed (e.g. on driver unbind).  Third, it leaks a struct device reference to the sibling device which is looked up using the spmi_device_from_of() every time a function (child) device is calling the revid function (e.g. on probe).  Fix this mess by reimplementing the revid lookup so that it is done only at probe of the PMIC device; the base device fetches the revid info from the hardware, while any secondary SPMI device fetches the information from the base device and caches it so that it can be accessed safely from its children.

On CPU hotplug MSR_IA32_XFD is reset to the init_fpstate.xfd, which wipes out any stale state. But the per CPU cached xfd value is not reset, which brings them out of sync.  As a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to update the MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernel space, which crashes the kernel.  To fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state together with MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.","","","","CWE-416","CWE-416 Use After Free"

This is done by iterating over all chunks (all the filters with the same priority) in the region and in each chunk iterating over all the filters.  If the migration fails, the code tries to migrate the filters back to the old region. However, the rollback itself can also fail in which case another migration will be erroneously performed. Besides the fact that this ping pong is not a very good idea, it also creates a problem.  Each virtual chunk references two chunks: The currently used one ('vchunk->chunk') and a backup ('vchunk->chunk2'). During migration the first holds the chunk we want to migrate filters to and the second holds the chunk we are migrating filters from.  The code currently assumes - but does not verify - that the backup chunk does not exist (NULL) if the currently used chunk does not reference the target region. This assumption breaks when we are trying to rollback a rollback, resulting in the backup chunk being overwritten and leaked [1].  Fix by not rolling back a failed rollback and add a warning to avoid future cases.

On the other hand, create_flow_handle tries hard to find and reference already existing identical rules instead of creating new ones.  These two behaviors can result in a situation where create_flow_handle 1) creates a new rule and references it, then 2) in a subsequent step during the same handle creation references it    again, resulting in a rule with a refcount of 2 that is not linked into the tree, will have a NULL parent and root and will result in a crash when the flow group is deleted because del_sw_hw_rule, invoked on rule deletion, assumes node->parent is != NULL.  This happened in the wild, due to another bug related to incorrect handling of duplicate pkt_reformat ids, which lead to the code in create_flow_handle incorrectly referencing a just-added rule in the same flow handle, resulting in the problem described above. Full details are at [1].  This patch changes add_rule_fg to add new rules without parents into the tree, properly initializing them and avoiding the crash.

Each change will take a time. `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()` works with MODULE_STATE_LIVE and MODULE_STATE_GOING. If we use `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()` separately, there is a chance that the first one is succeeded but the next one is failed because module->state becomes MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED between those operations.  In `check_kprobe_address_safe()`, if the second `__module_text_address()` is failed, that is ignored because it expected a kernel_text address. But it may have failed simply because module->state has been changed to MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. In this case, arm_kprobe() will try to modify non-exist module text address (use-after-free).  To fix this problem, we should not use separated `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()`, but use only `__module_text_address()` once and do `try_module_get(module)` which is only available with MODULE_STATE_LIVE.","","","","CWE-416","CWE-416 Use After Free"

But if the MTU becomes too low to transmit even the header + the VLAN specific part then the resizing of the local TT will never succeed. This can for example happen when the usable space is 110 bytes and 11 VLANs are on top of batman-adv. In this case, at least 116 byte would be needed. There will just be an endless spam of     batman_adv: batadv0: Forced to purge local tt entries to fit new maximum fragment MTU (110)  in the log but the function will never finish. Problem here is that the timeout will be halved all the time and will then stagnate at 0 and therefore never be able to reduce the table even more.  There are other scenarios possible with a similar result. The number of BATADV_TT_CLIENT_NOPURGE entries in the local TT can for example be too high to fit inside a packet. Such a scenario can therefore happen also with only a single VLAN + 7 non-purgable addresses - requiring at least 120 bytes.  While this should be handled proactively when:  * interface with too low MTU is added * VLAN is added * non-purgeable local mac is added * MTU of an attached interface is reduced * fragmentation setting gets disabled (which most likely requires dropping   attached interfaces)  not all of these scenarios can be prevented because batman-adv is only consuming events without the the possibility to prevent these actions (non-purgable MAC address added, MTU of an attached interface is reduced). It is therefore necessary to also make sure that the code is able to handle also the situations when there were already incompatible system configuration are present.","","","","CWE-835","CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')"

The issue can be reproduced like this: ip link add name bond0 type bond miimon 100 mode balance-xor ip link set dev eth0 master bond0  The reason is because when adding a interface under the lag it would go through all the ports and try to figure out which other ports are under that lag interface. And the issue is that lan966x can have ports that are NULL pointer as they are not probed. So then iterating over these ports it would just crash as they are NULL pointers.

We could prevent from that race by serializing i915_active_fini() with __active_retire() via ref->tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from being used, e.g. from __i915_vma_retire() called at the end of __active_retire(), after that VMA has been already freed by a concurrent i915_vma_destroy() on return from the i915_active_fini().  Then, we should rather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.  Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the GT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long enough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released and the GT parked.  I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915: Remove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from a dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref, to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref. However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a bug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9 (""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").  A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself. Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active intel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that intel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the VMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.  Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it, and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However, exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes idle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use async variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency, take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.  v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:     - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),     - using async variant of _put(),     - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,     - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex. v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing     a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and     there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of     intel_gt_pm_get/put_async(). v5: Replace ""tile"" with ""GT"" across commit description (Rodrigo),   -  ---truncated---","","","","CWE-416","CWE-416 Use After Free"

Looking at the remove function there is a chance that we will drop a rule that maps to a non-deactivated element.  Removal happens in two steps, first we do a lookup for key k and return the to-be-removed element and mark it as inactive in the next generation. Then, in a second step, the element gets removed from the set/map.  The _remove function does not work correctly if we have more than one element that share the same key.  This can happen if we insert an element into a set when the set already holds an element with same key, but the element mapping to the existing key has timed out or is not active in the next generation.  In such case its possible that removal will unmap the wrong element. If this happens, we will leak the non-deactivated element, it becomes unreachable.  The element that got deactivated (and will be freed later) will remain reachable in the set data structure, this can result in a crash when such an element is retrieved during lookup (stale pointer).  Add a check that the fully matching key does in fact map to the element that we have marked as inactive in the deactivation step. If not, we need to continue searching.  Add a bug/warn trap at the end of the function as well, the remove function must not ever be called with an invisible/unreachable/non-existent element.  v2: avoid uneeded temporary variable (Stefano)","","","","CWE-476","CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference"

Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off the completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the work will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting on the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the work to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very small delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a new request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the remaining work is really just:          trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);          __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);          mmput(mm);  and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is still alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.  Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with ""wakeup all"" work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a workqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes __flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).

This could cause, amongst other bad possibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by free_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.  This is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a test case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is possible (see link below).  Fix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall swapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that the swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device() because it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting the reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in free_swap_and_cache().

So the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn si->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().  Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are still references by swap entries.  Process 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry. Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.  Process 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache(). -> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE [then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]  Process 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache(). -> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE  Process 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls __try_to_reclaim_swap().  __try_to_reclaim_swap()->folio_free_swap()->delete_from_swap_cache()-> put_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()-> swap_entry_free()->swap_range_free()-> ...

However, in i915 there are two separate code paths, which both release either drvdata or hwmon and either can be released before the other. These code paths (for device unbind) are as follows (see also the bug referenced below):  Call Trace: release_nodes+0x11/0x70 devres_release_group+0xb2/0x110 component_unbind_all+0x8d/0xa0 component_del+0xa5/0x140 intel_pxp_tee_component_fini+0x29/0x40 [i915] intel_pxp_fini+0x33/0x80 [i915] i915_driver_remove+0x4c/0x120 [i915] i915_pci_remove+0x19/0x30 [i915] pci_device_remove+0x32/0xa0 device_release_driver_internal+0x19c/0x200 unbind_store+0x9c/0xb0  and  Call Trace: release_nodes+0x11/0x70 devres_release_all+0x8a/0xc0 device_unbind_cleanup+0x9/0x70 device_release_driver_internal+0x1c1/0x200 unbind_store+0x9c/0xb0  This means that in i915, if use devm, we cannot gurantee that hwmon will always be released before drvdata. Which means that we have a uaf if hwmon sysfs is accessed when drvdata has been released but hwmon hasn't.  The only way out of this seems to be do get rid of devm_ and release/free everything explicitly during device unbind.  v2: Change commit message and other minor code changes v3: Cleanup from i915_hwmon_register on error (Armin Wolf) v4: Eliminate potential static analyzer warning (Rodrigo)     Eliminate fetch_and_zero (Jani) v5: Restore previous logic for ddat_gt->hwmon_dev error return (Andi)","","","","CWE-400","CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary python code if they can control the input prompt and the server is configured with VectorSQLDatabaseChain.  **Notes:**  Impact on the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the vulnerable component:  Confidentiality: Code execution happens within the impacted component, in this case langchain-experimental, so all resources are necessarily accessible.  Integrity: There is nothing protected by the impacted component inherently. Although anything returned from the component counts as 'information' for which the trustworthiness can be compromised.  Availability: The loss of availability isn't caused by the attack itself, but it happens as a result during the attacker's post-exploitation steps.   Impact on the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the subsequent system:  As a legitimate low-privileged user of the package (PR:L) the attacker does not have more access to data owned by the package as a result of this vulnerability than they did with normal usage (e.g. can query the DB). The unintended action that one can perform by breaking out of the app environment and exfiltrating files, making remote connections etc. happens during the post exploitation phase in the subsequent system - in this case, the OS.

The patch adding the feature_flags field has an early bail out if the feature_flags field is not part of the opts struct (via the OPTS_HAS) macro, but the patch adding xdp_zc_max_segs does not.

When the NTB is parsed, unwrap call looks for any leftover bytes in SKB provided by u_ether and if there are any pending bytes, it treats them as a separate NTB and parses it. But in case the second NTB (as per unwrap call) is faulty/corrupt, all the datagrams that were parsed properly in the first NTB and saved in rx_list are dropped.  Adding a few custom traces showed the following: [002] d..1  7828.532866: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out: req 000000003868811a length 1025/16384 zsI ==> 0 [002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb toprocess: 1025 [002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342 [002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb seq: 0xce67 [002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x400 [002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb ndp_len: 0x10 [002] d..1  7828.532869: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: Parsed NTB with 1 frames  In this case, the giveback is of 1025 bytes and block length is 1024. The rest 1 byte (which is 0x00) won't be parsed resulting in drop of all datagrams in rx_list.  Same is case with packets of size 2048: [002] d..1  7828.557948: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out: req 0000000011dfd96e length 2049/16384 zsI ==> 0 [002] d..1  7828.557949: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342 [002] d..1  7828.557950: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x800  Lecroy shows one byte coming in extra confirming that the byte is coming in from PC:   Transfer 2959 - Bytes Transferred(1025)  Timestamp((18.524 843 590)  - Transaction 8391 - Data(1025 bytes) Timestamp(18.524 843 590)  --- Packet 4063861        Data(1024 bytes)        Duration(2.117us) Idle(14.700ns) Timestamp(18.524 843 590)  --- Packet 4063863        Data(1 byte)        Duration(66.160ns) Time(282.000ns) Timestamp(18.524 845 722)  According to Windows driver, no ZLP is needed if wBlockLength is non-zero, because the non-zero wBlockLength has already told the function side the size of transfer to be expected. However, there are in-market NCM devices that rely on ZLP as long as the wBlockLength is multiple of wMaxPacketSize. To deal with such devices, it pads an extra 0 at end so the transfer is no longer multiple of wMaxPacketSize.","","","","CWE-476","CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference"

This vulnerability allows a regular user to modify the application's configuration file to redirect update checks to an arbitrary server, which can then be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2024-29209 to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.  The issue stems from improper permission settings on the application's configuration file, which is stored in a common directory accessible to all users. This file includes critical parameters, such as the update server URL. By default, the application does not enforce adequate access controls on this file, allowing non-privileged users to modify it without administrative consent.  An attacker with regular user access can alter the update server URL specified in the configuration file to point to a malicious server. When the application performs its next update check, it will contact the attacker-controlled server. If the system is also vulnerable to CVE-2024-29209, the attacker can deliver a malicious update package that, when executed, grants them elevated privileges.  Impact: This vulnerability can lead to a regular user executing code with administrative privileges. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, installation of additional malware, and a full takeover of the affected system.  Affected Products: Phish Alert Button (PAB) for Outlook versions 1.10.0-1.10.11 Second Chance Client versions 2.0.0-2.0.9 PIQ Client versions 1.0.0-1.0.15  Remediation: KnowBe4 has released a patch that corrects the permission settings on the configuration file to prevent unauthorized modifications. Automated updates will be pushed to address this issue. Users of affected versions should verify the latest version is applied and, if not, apply the latest updates provided by KnowBe4.  Workarounds: Manually set the correct permissions on the configuration file to restrict write access to administrators only.  Credits: This vulnerability was discovered by Ceri Coburn at Pen Test Partners, who reported it responsibly to the vendor. ","","","","CWE-269","CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management"

This works in most cases, but the devils are always in details.  ""MODULE"" is defined when the target code (i.e. the sound core) is built as a module; but this doesn't mean that the caller is also built-in or not.  Namely, when only the sound core is built-in (CONFIG_SND=y) while the driver is a module (CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m), the passed module pointer is ignored even if it's non-NULL, and card->module remains as NULL.  This would result in the missing module reference up/down at the device open/close, leading to a race with the code execution after the module removal.  For addressing the bug, move the assignment of card->module again out of ifdef.  The WARN_ON() is still wrapped with ifdef because the module can be really NULL when all sound drivers are built-in.  Note that we keep 'ifdef MODULE' for WARN_ON(), otherwise it would lead to a false-positive NULL module check.  Admittedly it won't catch perfectly, i.e. no check is performed when CONFIG_SND=y.  But, it's no real problem as it's only for debugging, and the condition is pretty rare.","","","","CWE-476","CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference"

There is a scenario where the FFS application issues an AIO cancel call, while the UDC is handling a soft disconnect.  For a DWC3 based implementation, the callstack looks like the following:      DWC3 Gadget                               FFS Application dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect()              ...   --> dwc3_stop_active_transfers()     --> dwc3_gadget_giveback(-ESHUTDOWN)       --> ffs_epfile_async_io_complete()   ffs_aio_cancel()         --> usb_ep_free_request()            --> usb_ep_dequeue()  There is currently no locking implemented between the AIO completion handler and AIO cancel, so the issue occurs if the completion routine is running in parallel to an AIO cancel call coming from the FFS application. As the completion call frees the USB request (io_data->req) the FFS application is also referencing it for the usb_ep_dequeue() call.  This can lead to accessing a stale/hanging pointer.  commit b566d38857fc (""usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data->status consistently"") relocated the usb_ep_free_request() into ffs_epfile_async_io_complete(). However, in order to properly implement locking to mitigate this issue, the spinlock can't be added to ffs_epfile_async_io_complete(), as usb_ep_dequeue() (if successfully dequeuing a USB request) will call the function driver's completion handler in the same context.  Hence, leading into a deadlock.  Fix this issue by moving the usb_ep_free_request() back to ffs_user_copy_worker(), and ensuring that it explicitly sets io_data->req to NULL after freeing it within the ffs->eps_lock.  This resolves the race condition above, as the ffs_aio_cancel() routine will not continue attempting to dequeue a request that has already been freed, or the ffs_user_copy_work() not freeing the USB request until the AIO cancel is done referencing it.  This fix depends on   commit b566d38857fc (""usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data->status   consistently"")","","","","CWE-362","CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')"

In the following crash [1], syzbot managed to trigger a divide by zero in tcp_rcv_space_adjust()  A socket makes the following state transitions, without ever calling tcp_init_transfer(), meaning tcp_init_buffer_space() is also not called.           TCP_CLOSE connect()          TCP_SYN_SENT          TCP_SYN_RECV shutdown() -> tcp_shutdown(sk, SEND_SHUTDOWN)          TCP_FIN_WAIT1  To fix this issue, change tcp_shutdown() to not perform a TCP_SYN_RECV -> TCP_FIN_WAIT1 transition, which makes no sense anyway.  When tcp_rcv_state_process() later changes socket state from TCP_SYN_RECV to TCP_ESTABLISH, then look at sk->sk_shutdown to finally enter TCP_FIN_WAIT1 state, and send a FIN packet from a sane socket state.  This means tcp_send_fin() can now be called from BH context, and must use GFP_ATOMIC allocations.
