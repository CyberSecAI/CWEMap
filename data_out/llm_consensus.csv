"CVE-2021-47368","In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\\n\\nenetc: Fix illegal access when reading affinity_hint\\n\\nirq_set_affinity_hit() stores a reference to the cpumask_t\\nparameter in the irq descriptor, and that reference can be\\naccessed later from irq_affinity_hint_proc_show(). Since\\nthe cpu_mask parameter passed to irq_set_affinity_hit() has\\nonly temporary storage (it's on the stack memory), later\\naccesses to it are illegal. Thus reads from the corresponding\\nprocfs affinity_hint file can result in paging request oops.\\n\\nThe issue is fixed by the get_cpu_mask() helper, which provides\\na permanent storage for the cpumask_t parameter.","CWE-400","Yes","0.9","","claude_response_20240720_235323.json","","","",""
"CVE-2021-47482","In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\\n\\nnet: batman-adv: fix error handling\\n\\nSyzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was\\nin wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().\\n\\nBefore this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case\\nof any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well, when\\nthere is some kind of indicator, which can tell which parts of batadv are\\ninitialized; but there isn't any.\\n\\nAll written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide\\nODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work, syzbot was able to hit\\nGPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]\\n\\nTo fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one.\\nIt is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling\\npath 2) It improves the performance, since we won't call unneeded\\nbatadv_*_free() functions.\\n\\nSo, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory\\nbefore returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free()\\nand open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching\\nuninitialized fields.","CWE-544","Yes","0.8","","claude_response_20240720_235323.json","","","",""
"CVE-2021-47371","In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\\n\\nnexthop: Fix memory leaks in nexthop notification chain listeners\\n\\nsyzkaller discovered memory leaks [1] that can be reduced to the\\nfollowing commands:\\n\\n # ip nexthop add id 1 blackhole\\n # devlink dev reload pci/0000:06:00.0\\n\\nAs part of the reload flow, mlxsw will unregister its netdevs and then\\nunregister from the nexthop notification chain. Before unregistering\\nfrom the notification chain, mlxsw will receive delete notifications for\\nnexthop objects using netdevs registered by mlxsw or their uppers. mlxsw\\nwill not receive notifications for nexthops using netdevs that are not\\ndismantled as part of the reload flow. For example, the blackhole\\nnexthop above that internally uses the loopback netdev as its nexthop\\ndevice.\\n\\nOne way to fix this problem is to have listeners flush their nexthop\\ntables after unregistering from the notification chain. This is\\nerror-prone as evident by this patch and also not symmetric with the\\nregistration path where a listener receives a dump of all the existing\\nnexthops.\\n\\nTherefore, fix this problem by replaying delete notifications for the\\nlistener being unregistered. This is symmetric to the registration path\\nand also consistent with the netdev notification chain.\\n\\nThe above means that unregister_nexthop_notifier(), like\\nregister_nexthop_notifier(), will have to take RTNL in order to iterate\\nover the existing nexthops and that any callers of the function cannot\\nhold RTNL. This is true for mlxsw and netdevsim, but not for the VXLAN\\ndriver. To avoid a deadlock, change the latter to unregister its nexthop\\nlistener without holding RTNL, making it symmetric to the registration\\npath.\\n\\n[1]\\nunreferenced object 0xffff88806173d600 (size 512):\\n  comm ""syz-executor.0"", pid 1290, jiffies 4295583142 (age 143.507s)\\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\\n    41 9d 1e 60 80 88 ff ff 08 d6 73 61 80 88 ff ff  A..`......sa....\\n    08 d6 73 61 80 88 ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ..sa............\\n  backtrace:\\n    [<ffffffff81a6b576>] kmemleak_alloc_recursive include/linux/kmemleak.h:43 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff81a6b576>] slab_post_alloc_hook+0x96/0x490 mm/slab.h:522\\n    [<ffffffff81a716d3>] slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:3206 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff81a716d3>] slab_alloc mm/slub.c:3214 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff81a716d3>] kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x163/0x370 mm/slub.c:3231\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] kmalloc include/linux/slab.h:591 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] kzalloc include/linux/slab.h:721 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] mlxsw_sp_nexthop_obj_group_create drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_router.c:4918 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] mlxsw_sp_nexthop_obj_new drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_router.c:5054 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] mlxsw_sp_nexthop_obj_event+0x59a/0x2910 drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_router.c:5239\\n    [<ffffffff813ef67d>] notifier_call_chain+0xbd/0x210 kernel/notifier.c:83\\n    [<ffffffff813f0662>] blocking_notifier_call_chain kernel/notifier.c:318 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff813f0662>] blocking_notifier_call_chain+0x72/0xa0 kernel/notifier.c:306\\n    [<ffffffff8384b9c6>] call_nexthop_notifiers+0x156/0x310 net/ipv4/nexthop.c:244\\n    [<ffffffff83852bd8>] insert_nexthop net/ipv4/nexthop.c:2336 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff83852bd8>] nexthop_add net/ipv4/nexthop.c:2644 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff83852bd8>] rtm_new_nexthop+0x14e8/0x4d10 net/ipv4/nexthop.c:2913\\n    [<ffffffff833e9a78>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x448/0xbf0 net/core/rtnetlink.c:5572\\n    [<ffffffff83608703>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x173/0x480 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2504\\n    [<ffffffff833de032>] rtnetlink_rcv+0x22/0x30 net/core/rtnetlink.c:5590\\n    [<ffffffff836069de>] netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1314 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff836069de>] netlink_unicast+0x5ae/0x7f0 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1340\\n    [<ffffffff83607501>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8e1/0xe30 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1929\\n    [<ffffffff832fde84>] sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:704 [inline\\n---truncated---","CWE-400","Yes","0.9","","claude_response_20240720_235323.json","","","",""

Before unregistering\\nfrom the notification chain, mlxsw will receive delete notifications for\\nnexthop objects using netdevs registered by mlxsw or their uppers. mlxsw\\nwill not receive notifications for nexthops using netdevs that are not\\ndismantled as part of the reload flow. For example, the blackhole\\nnexthop above that internally uses the loopback netdev as its nexthop\\ndevice.\\n\\nOne way to fix this problem is to have listeners flush their nexthop\\ntables after unregistering from the notification chain. This is\\nerror-prone as evident by this patch and also not symmetric with the\\nregistration path where a listener receives a dump of all the existing\\nnexthops.\\n\\nTherefore, fix this problem by replaying delete notifications for the\\nlistener being unregistered. This is symmetric to the registration path\\nand also consistent with the netdev notification chain.\\n\\nThe above means that unregister_nexthop_notifier(), like\\nregister_nexthop_notifier(), will have to take RTNL in order to iterate\\nover the existing nexthops and that any callers of the function cannot\\nhold RTNL. This is true for mlxsw and netdevsim, but not for the VXLAN\\ndriver. To avoid a deadlock, change the latter to unregister its nexthop\\nlistener without holding RTNL, making it symmetric to the registration\\npath.\\n\\n[1]\\nunreferenced object 0xffff88806173d600 (size 512):\\n  comm ""syz-executor.0"", pid 1290, jiffies 4295583142 (age 143.507s)\\n  hex dump (first 32 bytes):\\n    41 9d 1e 60 80 88 ff ff 08 d6 73 61 80 88 ff ff  A..`......sa....\\n    08 d6 73 61 80 88 ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ..sa............\\n  backtrace:\\n    [<ffffffff81a6b576>] kmemleak_alloc_recursive include/linux/kmemleak.h:43 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff81a6b576>] slab_post_alloc_hook+0x96/0x490 mm/slab.h:522\\n    [<ffffffff81a716d3>] slab_alloc_node mm/slub.c:3206 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff81a716d3>] slab_alloc mm/slub.c:3214 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff81a716d3>] kmem_cache_alloc_trace+0x163/0x370 mm/slub.c:3231\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] kmalloc include/linux/slab.h:591 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] kzalloc include/linux/slab.h:721 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] mlxsw_sp_nexthop_obj_group_create drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_router.c:4918 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] mlxsw_sp_nexthop_obj_new drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_router.c:5054 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff82e8681a>] mlxsw_sp_nexthop_obj_event+0x59a/0x2910 drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_router.c:5239\\n    [<ffffffff813ef67d>] notifier_call_chain+0xbd/0x210 kernel/notifier.c:83\\n    [<ffffffff813f0662>] blocking_notifier_call_chain kernel/notifier.c:318 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff813f0662>] blocking_notifier_call_chain+0x72/0xa0 kernel/notifier.c:306\\n    [<ffffffff8384b9c6>] call_nexthop_notifiers+0x156/0x310 net/ipv4/nexthop.c:244\\n    [<ffffffff83852bd8>] insert_nexthop net/ipv4/nexthop.c:2336 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff83852bd8>] nexthop_add net/ipv4/nexthop.c:2644 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff83852bd8>] rtm_new_nexthop+0x14e8/0x4d10 net/ipv4/nexthop.c:2913\\n    [<ffffffff833e9a78>] rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x448/0xbf0 net/core/rtnetlink.c:5572\\n    [<ffffffff83608703>] netlink_rcv_skb+0x173/0x480 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:2504\\n    [<ffffffff833de032>] rtnetlink_rcv+0x22/0x30 net/core/rtnetlink.c:5590\\n    [<ffffffff836069de>] netlink_unicast_kernel net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1314 [inline]\\n    [<ffffffff836069de>] netlink_unicast+0x5ae/0x7f0 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1340\\n    [<ffffffff83607501>] netlink_sendmsg+0x8e1/0xe30 net/netlink/af_netlink.c:1929\\n    [<ffffffff832fde84>] sock_sendmsg_nosec net/socket.c:704 [inline\\n---truncated---","CWE-400","","","","","Yes","0.9","","gemini_response_20240720_235331.json"

This\\ncould trigger a NULL-pointer dereference when attempting to access the\\ndriver data of the unbound device.\\n\\nSecond, it accesses driver data of a sibling device directly and without\\nany locking, which means that the driver data may be freed while it is\\nbeing accessed (e.g. on driver unbind).\\n\\nThird, it leaks a struct device reference to the sibling device which is\\nlooked up using the spmi_device_from_of() every time a function (child)\\ndevice is calling the revid function (e.g. on probe).\\n\\nFix this mess by reimplementing the revid lookup so that it is done only\\nat probe of the PMIC device; the base device fetches the revid info from\\nthe hardware, while any secondary SPMI device fetches the information\\nfrom the base device and caches it so that it can be accessed safely\\nfrom its children.

An app exploiting this vulnerability only needs to declare and request the single missing permission and no user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows: TCL 10L (TCL/T770B/T1_LITE:11/RKQ1.210107.001/8BIC:user/release-keys) and TCL 30Z (TCL/4188R/Jetta_ATT:12/SP1A.210812.016/LV8E:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU5P:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU61:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU66:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU68:user/release-keys, TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU6P:user/release-keys, and TCL/T602DL/Jetta_TF:12/SP1A.210812.016/vU6X:user/release-keys). This malicious app declares the missing permission named com.tct.smart.switchphone.permission.SWITCH_DATA as a normal permission, requests the missing permission, and uses it to interact with the com.tct.smart.switchdata.DataService service component that is declared in vulnerable apps that execute with ""system"" privileges to perform arbitrary file reads/writes.","CWE-276","","","","","No","0.7","CWE-276 (Incorrect Default Permissions) is too general.

Then, we should\\nrather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.\\n\\nSince __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the\\nGT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long\\nenough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released\\nand the GT parked.\\n\\nI believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915:\\nRemove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from\\na dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,\\nto i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.\\nHowever, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a\\nbug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9\\n(""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").\\n\\nA VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.\\nInstead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active\\nintel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that\\nintel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the\\nVMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.\\n\\nFix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,\\nand putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,\\nexclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes\\nidle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use\\nasync variant of wakeref put.

"CVE-2024-26960","In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\\n\\nmm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()\\n\\nThere was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and\\nteardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was\\nrunning in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other bad\\npossibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by\\nfree_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.\\n\\nThis is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a\\ntest case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is\\npossible (see link below).\\n\\nFix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall\\nswapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that\\nthe swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()\\nbecause it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting\\nthe reference and swapoff.
