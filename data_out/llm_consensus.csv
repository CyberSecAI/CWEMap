"CVE-2021-35559","Vulnerability in the Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Swing). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u311, 8u301, 11.0.12, 17; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.3 and 21.2.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.1 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).","CWE-400","Yes","0.9","","No","0.8","The description indicates a partial Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, which aligns more closely with CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption). While CWE-400 can sometimes be a consequence of improper resource allocation (CWE-770), the description emphasizes the DoS impact rather than the root cause of resource mismanagement."
"CVE-2021-26928","BIRD through 2.0.7 does not provide functionality for password authentication of BGP peers. Because of this, products that use BIRD (which may, for example, include Tigera products in some configurations, as well as products of other vendors) may have been susceptible to route redirection for Denial of Service and/or Information Disclosure. NOTE: a researcher has asserted that the behavior is within Tigeras area of responsibility; however, Tigera disagrees","CWE-306","Yes","0.9","","No","0.8","While CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function) seems relevant at first glance, the core issue isn't the complete absence of authentication but rather the lack of *password* authentication specifically for BGP peers. BIRD might offer other authentication mechanisms. The description highlights a configuration weakness where password authentication, a potentially more secure option, isn't enforced. A more appropriate CWE might be CWE-256 (Plaintext Storage of a Password) or CWE-327 (Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm), depending on the alternative authentication methods offered by BIRD and their robustness.

"CVE-2021-26918","The ProBot bot through 2021-02-08 for Discord might allow attackers to interfere with the intended purpose of the ""Send an image when a user joins the server"" feature (or possibly have unspecified other impact) because the uploader web service allows double extensions (such as .html.jpg) with the text/html content type. NOTE: there may not be cases in which an uploader web service is customer controlled; however, the nature of the issue has substantial interaction with customer controlled configuration. NOTE: the vendor states ""This is just an uploader (like any other one) which uploads files to cloud storage and accepts various file types. There is no kind of vulnerability and it won't compromise either the client side or the server side.","CWE-434","No","0.7","The CVE description does not provide enough information to determine if CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) is the appropriate weakness. While it mentions that the uploader web service allows double extensions with the text/html content type, it does not explicitly state that this leads to unrestricted file upload or execution of malicious code. The vendor's statement also suggests that this may not be a vulnerability. More information is needed to confirm if this issue falls under CWE-434 or if it is a different weakness related to improper input validation or content spoofing.","No","0.8","While CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) seems plausible at first glance due to the mention of double extensions, the CVE description explicitly states that the service is just an uploader to cloud storage. The core issue seems to be a lack of validation for content type and potential misinterpretation of files with double extensions, which could lead to issues like content spoofing or potential client-side attacks depending on how the cloud storage handles and serves these files. A more appropriate CWE might be CWE-436 (Improper Handling of files with Double Extension) or CWE-346 (Origin Validation Error)."
