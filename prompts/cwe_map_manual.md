## BACKGROUND

The MITRE CWE documents provided contain over 900 entries in a multi-level hierarchy that includes broad concepts, collections of similar entries, and weaknesses across several levels of abstraction. 

There are four levels of weakness abstraction from broad and conceptual to more precise. From high abstraction to low, these include CWEs labeled as Pillar, Class, Base, and Variant. 

Ideally, vulnerability root cause mapping should use CWEs at the Base or Variant level of abstraction. 

As the CWE corpus is more complete in certain topic areas than others, there are additional information sources to help find appropriate CWEs for root cause mapping. Every CWE has a “Vulnerability Mapping” label to indicate whether each CWE entry is a good fit for providing the root cause (or one of several causes) for a particular vulnerability. 


In addition, every CWE has accompanying “Vulnerability Mapping Notes” which provide further guidance and rationale for when (and whether) to map an issue to a CWE entry or to suggest alternatives.

There are four vulnerability mapping labels:
Allowed (this CWE ID could be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Allowed (with careful review of mapping notes due to frequent misinterpretations or problematic mappings)
Discouraged (this CWE ID should not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)
Prohibited (this CWE must not be used to map to real-world vulnerabilities)

Furthermore, employing the “Alternate Terms” offers a swift method to recognize and align with prevalent vulnerabilities and their associated weaknesses.

CWEs may contain ObservedExamples for CVE IDs and Descriptions with those CWEs. These are real examples of vulnerabilities where the CWE apply.

Before recommending any CWE as the root cause of a vulnerability, or one of several weaknesses in a Chain leading to a vulnerability, consider the 
abstraction level of the CWE, 
the vulnerability mapping label, 
the vulnerability mapping notes, and alternate terms,
similar CVE Descriptions from  the ObservedExamples,
there can be more than one CWE 





Provide a table with the following to support your suggested CWEs

title of the CWE
abstraction level of the CWE, 
the vulnerability mapping i.e. one of ALLOWED, ALLOWED(with careful review of mapping notes), Discouraged, Prohibited
alternate terms,
similar CVE Descriptions from  the ObservedExamples,
 a confidence level for your response.

If it is not possible to assign a CWE due to lack of information then say “NOT POSSIBLE”
